**AI-Enabled Document Scanner
Project Overview
The AI-Enabled Document Scanner is a smart scanning solution that processes and enhances document images using AI-based techniques. It allows users to scan, preprocess, and extract useful information from documents efficiently.

Steps to Solution
Project Setup:

Initialize a Git repository.
Create a Python-based environment with OpenCV and other required libraries.
Image Acquisition & Preprocessing:

Capture or upload document images.
Apply grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and edge detection.
Document Detection & Transformation:

Use contour detection and perspective transformation to extract the document area.
Text Extraction & Enhancement:

Apply OCR (Tesseract) for text recognition.
Improve clarity using thresholding techniques.
Output & Storage:

Save processed documents as images or PDFs.
Provide options for exporting and sharing.**
